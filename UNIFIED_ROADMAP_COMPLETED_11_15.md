## Phase 14: AI-Native Ecosystem Deepening (Completed Items)

### Serv-lang (Compiler + Runtime)
- **RAG pipeline keyword (AI.10)** — `rag "servstore://docs" { embed: "openai", chunk: 512 }` declares retrieval-augmented generation as infrastructure. Auto-index on write, inject context on `ai.chat()`.
- **Structured output (JSON mode) (AI.11)** — `ai.complete(prompt, schema: UserSchema)` forces LLM responses to conform to a Serv struct. Compiler validates schema at build time.
- **Streaming responses (AI.12)** — `ai.stream(prompt, fn(chunk) { conn.send(chunk) })` for server-sent event streaming. Currently `ai.chat()` blocks until complete.
- **Prompt template library (AI.13)** — `import "stdlib/prompts"` with variable injection, versioning, and A/B testing hooks.
- **AI eval framework (AI.14)** — `test "quality" { assert ai.eval(prompt, expected, threshold: 0.8) }` for LLM output quality testing in `serv test`.

### ServGate (AI Gateway)
- **Token budget enforcement per route (AI.15)** — Max tokens/cost per API key per day. Reject when exhausted. Dashboard burn rate.
- **Prompt versioning & A/B routing (AI.16)** — Route % of traffic to different system prompts. Track outcome quality per version.
- **Response quality scoring (AI.17)** — Auto-score LLM responses for hallucination risk via factual grounding check against RAG context.
- **Multi-model fallback chain (AI.18)** — `models: [gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, claude-3-5-sonnet]` — try next on failure/timeout.
- **Semantic rate limiting (AI.19)** — Rate limit by semantic similarity of requests, not just IP. Prevent same question rephrased 100 ways.

### ServStore (AI Storage)
- **Conversational object query (AI.20)** — `GET /bucket?ask=<question>` generates embedding, searches, synthesizes answer (RAG on stored objects).
- **Auto-summarization on upload (AI.21)** — Generate and store summaries as metadata on document upload. Browse-by-summary without downloading.
- **Similarity deduplication (AI.22)** — On upload, check if semantically similar document exists (cosine > 0.95). Warn or auto-deduplicate.
- **Classification tags on ingest (AI.23)** — Auto-classify uploaded objects (invoices, contracts, logs, images) via lightweight model. Searchable tags.

### ServQueue (AI Messaging)
- **Semantic message routing (AI.24)** — Route messages to subscribers based on content meaning: `subscribe "support" where ai.classify(msg) == "billing"`.
- **DLQ auto-summarization (AI.25)** — When messages pile up in DLQ, generate summary.
- **Message pattern anomaly detection (AI.26)** — Learn normal throughput patterns. Alert on significant volume/content shifts.

### ServConsole (AI Operations)
- **Natural language log search (AI.27)** — "Show errors from ServAuth where users couldn't login" → structured log query + filters.
- **Incident root cause synthesis (AI.28)** — On alert: analyze deploys, config changes, correlated metrics, similar past incidents. One-paragraph hypothesis.
- **Auto-generated runbooks (AI.29)** — Observe how operators respond to recurring alerts. After 3 manual resolutions, suggest automated runbook.
- **Anomaly explanation (AI.30)** — When metric spikes, explain why.

### ServAuth (AI Security)
- **Adaptive risk scoring (AI.31)** — Score login attempts: new device + unusual time + different geo = high risk → step-up to MFA.
- **Credential stuffing detection (AI.32)** — Behavioral clustering to detect many IPs using same password list. Auto-block suspicious cohorts.

### ServTrace (AI Observability)
- **Auto-correlate slow spans (AI.33)** — Identify root cause span and explain: "95% latency in ServDB query — missing index on order_date".
- **Predictive SLO breach (AI.34)** — Given current error rate trajectory, predict when SLO will be violated. "Error budget exhausted in 3 days".

### ServCron & ServFlow (AI Automation)
- **Smart scheduling (AI.35)** — Analyze job execution history (duration, resource usage, conflicts). Suggest optimal scheduling windows.
- **AI decision steps in workflows (AI.36)** — `step "classify" { ai.classify(input, ["approve", "review", "reject"]) }` — AI-powered branching.
- **Workflow generation from description (AI.37)** — NL prompt → DAG definition: "receives order → validates payment → notifies warehouse → sends email".
